Proper documentation using Markdown (MD) refers to creating comprehensive, structured, and easily readable documents using the Markdown language. Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text formatting syntax that can be converted to HTML and other formats. It's widely used for README files, documentation, notes, and for content in version control systems like GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab.

When documenting a project in Markdown, the goal is to provide clear, concise, and useful information about the project's purpose, setup, usage, features, configuration, and any other relevant details. This ensures that developers, users, and any stakeholders can easily understand and work with the project.

Here's a basic outline of how to structure your project documentation using Markdown:
